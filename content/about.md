# Welcome to Mr. RootBoot

**My Journey into Offensive Security and Compliance**

I'm on a focused path to become a professional in offensive security, ethical hacking, and compliance management. While my background is in MLOps leadership within a critical infrastructure supply chain, my current effort is dedicated to mastering offensive techniques, learning core security frameworks, and preparing for certifications that validate practical capability and risk comprehension.

I started my cybersecurity journey during university by founding and leading a CTF team—an experience that taught me how to think like an attacker. Today, I’m formalizing and deepening those skills through platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box, while pursuing high-impact certifications like eJPT, PNPT, and OSCP.

This blog is my space to learn in public—documenting what I study, the tools I experiment with, the labs I complete, and the real-world concepts I try to understand. I believe that the best way to learn deeply is to share openly, so whether I’m summarizing key security concepts or walking through my first CTF, I aim to grow while helping others on a similar path.
