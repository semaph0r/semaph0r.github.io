# Welcome to RootBoot 👋

Hi, and welcome to **RootBoot** — my personal space where I document my journey into **offensive security**, **ethical hacking**, and **compliance management**.

This blog, hosted at **mr.rootboot.sh**, will be my **learning journal** as I explore everything from hands-on hacking labs to security certifications and regulatory frameworks.  
I’ll share **what I learn**, **how I practice**, and **the tools and techniques I use** — while staying focused on growing into a **professional in cybersecurity**.

## 🌱 Why I Started This Blog

Over the last few years, my professional background has been in **MLOps leadership** within an **R&D department** serving customers in the **critical infrastructure sector**.  
After a **large-scale security incident** at my company in 2023, I’ve seen firsthand how vital **security by design**, **regular assessments**, and **regulatory compliance** have become.

But beyond organizational priorities, I’ve personally decided to **go deeper into cybersecurity** — focusing on **offensive security** and **ethical hacking** to understand **how attackers think** and how to build **resilient systems**.
